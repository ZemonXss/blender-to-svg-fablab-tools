# Blender → SVG tools for plotters & fablabs

A small set of Blender addons designed to generate
clean, artistic SVGs for pen plotters, laser cutters,
CNC machines and other fablab tools.

## Included addons

### Advanced Edges to Curves:
- Convert mesh edges into clean 3D curves
- Polyline or Bezier output
- Subdivision for smooth, organic lines
- Ideal as a pre-SVG step

### Curve Camera SVG Exporter:
- Export Blender curves to SVG
- Viewport or camera-based projection
- Visible-only (occlusion) option
- Bezier export in orthographic mode
- Color per object
- One SVG layer per object

## Typical workflow:

Mesh / 3D / VR / AI
→ Advanced Edges to Curves
→ Curve Camera SVG Exporter
→ SVG
→ Plotter / Laser / CNC / Embroidery

These tools are developed as part of my drawing practice.

They are designed to bridge digital creation and physical drawing,
especially using pen plotters, laser cutters and fablab machines.
